# Spotlas

## Short description

Our goal is to create a platform for insider tips, a map where you can find lesser-known, special places away from the crowded places. This platform invites users to share their discoveries and create a community that continuously adds new places. In this way, we want to offer an inspiring alternative to large map platforms and encourage the exploration of special places.â€¯
